Do not remove this file to keep the directory in the distribution across
the development platforms:

This folder is a placeholder for auxiliary helper scripts which will make
the folder available for InfluxDB v2 instances and may install for it
automatically, for example plug-ins. Therefore a fixed directory location
within a structure is needed, albeit the structure itself can be copied
by the installers elsewhere, like for a Docker instance of InfluxdDB v2.

In this particular case, the directory will contain the database, i.e. the
user's data in a persistent manner so care need to be taken before deleting
this fodler.

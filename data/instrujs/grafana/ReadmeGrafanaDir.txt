Do not remove this file to keep the directory in the distribution across
the development platforms:

This folder is a placeholder for auxiliary helper scripts which will make
the folder available for Grafana instances and may install for it
automatically, for example plug-ins. Therefore a fixed directory location
within a structure is needed, albeit the structure itself can be copied
by the installers elsewhere, like for a Docker instance of Grafana.
